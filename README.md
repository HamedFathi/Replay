# Replay

Live coding is the best way for teaching and share your knowledge with others but as you know this is not easy! The idea behind writing this extension is to have live coding with hundred percent accuracy and less stressful moments!

You can achieve the goal in two different ways:

1. Recording everything via macros.
2. Replay a pre-defined script.

For the first approach, it is fast but not accurate because you are recording your mistakes too, so, I am using the second one to nail it! 

## Features

You have full control of the script that you want to type:

* Move the cursor in any direction and number you want.
* Using predefined utility commands to simplify the typing process.
* Calling commands available in VS Code e.g Format the document by `editor.action.formatDocument`.
* Present your code perfectly with manual and automatic pause/resume cycle.

## Usage
### Operational Characters

|  | Name | Description |
|:---------:|------|-------------|
| ↑         | up            | Move the cursor up one line |
| ↓         | down          | Move the cursor down one line |
| →         | right         | Move the cursor right one character |
| ←         | left          | Move the cursor left one character |
| ⤒         | first         | Move the cursor to the beginning of the first line |
| ⤓         | last          | Move the cursor to the beginning of the last line |
| ⇤        | begin         | Move the cursor to the beginning of the line |
| ⇥        | end           | Move the cursor to the end of the line |
|⮒         | newline       |  Adding a new line |
|⨷        |  remove-newline |  removng next new line      |
|⟿        |  whitespace     |  Adding a whitespace |
| ⌫       |  backspace      | Delete the character to the left of the cursor |
|⭯         | pause         | Pause the running process and ask user to continue via dialog |
|⧉        |  command        |  Adding some useful functionality to your script     |

You can use number after the below operational characters to write less repetetive code:

|  | Name | Description |
|:---------:|------|-------------|
| ↑2         | up-more        | Move the cursor up {N} lines |
| ↓10         | down-more      | Move the cursor down {N} lines |
| →5         | right-more     | Move the cursor right {N} characters |
| ←7         | left-more      | Move the cursor left {N} characters |
| ⮒3       | newline-more      | Adding {N} new lines |
|⟿4        | whitespace-more     |  Adding {N} whitespace |
| ⌫8       | backspace-more      | Delete {N} characters to the left of the cursor |
| ⭯6       | pause-more      | Pause for {N} seconds |

If you set `0` for the count, the extension automatically consider it as `1`.

col: 0
speed: 20
delay: 250
clean: true
next: ./sample2.vscreplay

Copy and paste the characters from this tutorial is not a good way! To work easier you can use the below snippets.
