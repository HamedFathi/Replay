The structure of a command is like

`⧉ verb:variable1:valieble2:...:variableN`

A `Command` always should use in a separate line so you cannot mix them with the other texts.

* `.vscreplay` is the extension.
* `config.vscreplay.js` is the file you can add your custom commands & options globaly.

`front-matter` for configs per file

```
